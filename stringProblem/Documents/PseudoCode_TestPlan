Pseudo code:
1. For one line code;  replace all the occurrences of the given input char from given input string. 
2. Another approach;
    1. Pass the arguments as String and the character to remove
    2. Add the condition for null check
    3. Convert the character into lower case for the consistency
    4. Write the for loop and read the string as toCharArray
    5. Check the existence of the given input character in the given input string
    6. Use the StringBuilder for String output
    7. Append all the character other than the character which needs to be removed


Test Plan/Test cases:
    1. Test the sunny day scenario/happy path/positive scenario.
    2. Verify the one line code for the string problem.
    3. Verify the case sensitive.
    4. Verify with the non existing character in a string. it should not remove any char.
    5. Provide empty char and test.
    6. Verify with input as null.
    8. Verify with the special characters. 
    note: Used sample data for the testing purpose.
